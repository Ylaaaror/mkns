    I WONT SAY( I'M INLOVE) LYRICS by Alan Menken and David Zippel

      <p>If there's a prize for rotten judgement</p>
      <p>I guess I've already won that</p>
      <p>No man is worth the aggravation</p>
      <p>That's ancient history, been there, done that!</p>
    
      <p>Who'd'ya think you're kiddin'</p>
      <p>He's the Earth and heaven to you</p>
      <p>Try to keep it hidden</p>
      <p>Honey, we can see right through you</p>
      <p>Girl, ya can't conceal it</p>
      <p>We know how ya feel and</p>
      <p>Who you're thinking of </p>
    
      <p>No chance, no way</p>
      <p>I won't say it, no, no</p>
    
      <p>You swoon, you sigh</p>
      <p>Why deny it, uh-oh </p>
    
      <p>It's too cliche</p>
      <p>I won't say I'm in love</p>
    
      <p>I thought my heart had learned its lesson</p>
      <p>It feels so good when you start out</p>
      <p>My head is screaming get a grip, girl</p>
      <p>Unless you're dying to cry your heart out</p>
      <p>Oh  </p>
    
      <p>You keep on denying</p>
      <p>Who you are and how you're feeling</p>
      <p>Baby, we're not buying</p>
      <p>Hon, we saw ya hit the ceiling</p>
      <p>Face it like a grown-up</p>
      <p>When ya gonna own up</p>
      <p>That ya got, got, got it bad</p>
    
      <p>No chance, now way</p>
      <p>I won't say it, no, no</p>
    
      <p>Give up, give in</p>
      <p>Check the grin you're in love</p>
    
      <p>This scene won't play,</p>
      <p>I won't say I'm in love</p>
    
      <p>You're doin flips read our lips</p>
      <p>You're in love</p>
    
      <p>You're way off base</p>
      <p>I won't say it</p>
      <p>Get off my case</p>
      <p>I won't say it</p>
    
      <p>Girl, don't be proud</p>
      <p>It's O.K. you're in love</p>
    
      <p>Oh</p>
      <p>At least out loud,</p>
      <p>I won't say I'm in love</p>
