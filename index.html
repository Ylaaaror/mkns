    I WONT SAY( I'M INLOVE) LYRICS by Alan Menken and David Zippel

      If there's a prize for rotten judgement
      I guess I've already won that
      No man is worth the aggravation
      That's ancient history, been there, done that!
    
      Who'd'ya think you're kiddin'
      He's the Earth and heaven to you
      Try to keep it hidden
      Honey, we can see right through you
      Girl, ya can't conceal it
      We know how ya feel and
      Who you're thinking of 
    
      No chance, no way
      I won't say it, no, no
    
      You swoon, you sigh
      Why deny it, uh-oh 
    
      It's too cliche
      I won't say I'm in love
    
      I thought my heart had learned its lesson
      It feels so good when you start out
      My head is screaming get a grip, girl
      Unless you're dying to cry your heart out
      Oh  
    
      You keep on denying
      Who you are and how you're feeling
      Baby, we're not buying
      Hon, we saw ya hit the ceiling
      Face it like a grown-up
      When ya gonna own up
      That ya got, got, got it bad
    
      No chance, now way 
      I won't say it, no, no
    
      Give up, give in
      Check the grin you're in love
    
      This scene won't play,
      I won't say I'm in love
    
      You're doin flips read our lips
      You're in love
    
      You're way off base
      I won't say it
      Get off my case
      I won't say it
    
      Girl, don't be proud
      It's O.K. you're in love
    
      Oh
      At least out loud,
      I won't say I'm in love
